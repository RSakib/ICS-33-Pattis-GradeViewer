This was made by me, Ragib Sakib, in a bored few hours, so sorry if this isn't perfect.
I used the Pandas and openpyxl libraries to create this quick grade viewer.

How to Use:
1. Simply drag your Pattis grades excel file in here and run the python script
2. You will then be prompted for the excel file name, the specific sheet name, and your student hashed id
3. It will then print your grades in a very long line

Options:
- If you don't want to always type in your information, simply set the enable_input bool to False in the code and set your values in stone.
